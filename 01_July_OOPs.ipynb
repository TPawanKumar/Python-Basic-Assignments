    "\n",
    "Ans. The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to design and create modular, reusable, and scalable software\n",
    "     by organizing code into objects that encapsulate data and behavior. OOP promotes concepts such as inheritance,\n",
    "     polymorphism, and encapsulation to improve code structure, maintainability, and extensibility."

    "\n",
    "Ans. In Python, objects are the fundamental building blocks of programs. They represent individual instances of classes and \n",
    "     encapsulate data and functionality together. Objects can have properties (attributes) that store information, such as\n",
    "     variables, and methods that define their behavior and allow them to perform actions. Objects can also interact with each\n",
    "    other, allowing for complex functionality and code organization. Object-oriented programming in Python revolves around the \n",

    "\n",
    "Ans. In object-oriented programming, attributes and methods are the building blocks of a class. Attributes, also known as \n",
    "     properties or member variables, are the characteristics or data associated with an object. They store information about \n",
    "    the state of an object. Methods, on the other hand, are functions defined within a class that perform specific actions or \n",
    "    operations on the object's attributes. They represent the behaviors or actions that an object can perform. By encapsulating\n",
    "    both data (attributes) and behaviors (methods) within a class, objects can interact with one another and their environment\n",
    "    in a structured and organized manner."

    "5. What is the difference between class variables and instance variables in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Class variables are defined within a class but outside of any methods. They are shared by all instances of the class and \n",
    "     are accessed using the class name. Class variables are created once when the class is defined, and any modifications to the\n",
    "    class variable will be reflected in all instances of the class. They are often used to store values that are common across\n",
    "    all instances, such as constants or default values.\n",
    "                       \n",
    "    On the other hand, instance variables are unique to each instance of a class. They are defined within a class's methods and\n",
    "    are accessed using the instance name. Each instance of the class has its own copy of the instance variables, which can have\n",
    "    different values. Instance variables are typically used to store data that is specific to an individual instance, such as \n",
    "    attributes or state.\n",

    "6. What is the purpose of the self parameter in Python class methods?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. In Python, the self parameter is used in class methods to refer to the instance of the class itself. It is a convention to\n",
    "     name this parameter \"self\" (although you can technically name it anything), and it must be the first parameter in any class\n",
    "    method definition.\n",
    "              The self parameter allows class methods to access and manipulate the instance variables and methods within the \n",
    "    class. When a method is called on an instance of the class, the instance is automatically passed as the self argument. This\n",
    "    allows the method to have access to the instance's attributes and perform actions specific to that instance.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Using the self parameter, we can modify instance variables, call other instance methods, or interact with the instance\n",
    "    in any desired way. It enables us to maintain state and behavior unique to each instance of the class.\n"
