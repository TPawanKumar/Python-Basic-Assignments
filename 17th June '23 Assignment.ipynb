    "1.\tWhat is the role of try and exception block?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.  The try and except block is a fundamental concept in error handling within programming languages. It allows developers\n",
    "      to anticipate and handle potential errors or exceptions that may occur during the execution of their code. The try block\n",
    "      encapsulates the code that could potentially generate an exception. If an exception occurs within the try block the flow\n",
    "      of control immediately transfers to the except block. The except block contains the code to handle the exception providing \n",
    "      a way for the program to gracefully recover from unexpected errors. By using try and except blocks developers can ensure \n",
    "      that their program continues to run smoothly even in the presence of errors. It allows for the handling of specific\n",
    "      exceptions resulting in more granular control over error handling and providing the ability to handle different types of \n",
    "      errors differently."

    "3.\tWhat happens if an exception occurs inside a try block and there is no matching except block?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. If an exception occurs inside a try block and there is no matching except block to handle it the exception will propagate\n",
    "     up the call stack until it is caught by an appropriate except block or until it reaches the top-level of the program. \n",
    "    If the exception is not caught it will result in the program terminating and an error message will be displayed.\n",
    "    The default behaviour of most programming languages is to print a stack trace which shows the sequence of function calls \n",
    "    that led to the point where the exception occurred. In some cases, the program may be able o gracefully handle the exception\n",
    "    by using a finally block if one is present. The code inside the finally block will always execute regardless of whether an \n",
    "    exception occurred or not. This allows the program to perform any necessary cleanup or resource release before terminating.\n",
    "    However, the finally block does not handle or catch the exception itself it is just executed before the program ends."

    "4.\tWhat is the difference between using a bare except block and specifying a specific exception type?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.    When writing code that includes error or exception handling there is a crucial distinction between using a bare \n",
    "       `except` block and specifying a specific exception type.\n",
    "1. Bare `except` block:\n",
    "   - A bare `except` block catches any type of exception that is raised within the `try` block.\n",
    "   - It doesn't differentiate between different exception types.\n",
    "   - This can be problematic because it makes it difficult to identify the specific cause of the error.\n",
    "   - It may result in unexpected or unintended error handling.\n",
    "   - It can make debugging and troubleshooting more challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of a bare `except` block:\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Some code that may raise exceptions\n",
    "except:\n",
    "    # Exception handling code\n",
    "2. Specifying a specific exception type:\n",
    "   - By specifying a specific exception type you can catch and handle only that particular type of exception.\n",
    "   - This allows for more accurate and targeted error handling.\n",
    "   - It provides clearer information about the cause of the error.\n",
    "   - It enables you to handle different exceptions in different ways tailoring the approach based on the type of error.\n",
